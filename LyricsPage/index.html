        <p class="realtext"> <span>Verse:</span> <br>
            Fatal, this attraction, <br>
            Yeah, we might just end up crashin'<br>
            But I'm ready if it happens with you <br>
            Meet me out in Cali <br>
            When I'm far away from family <br>
            And I need someone to hold onto <br>
            <br>
            You're the only thing I know <br>
            And I don't wanna let this go <br>
            Close to you I feelâ€”feel like I'm at home <br>
            Can't wait 'til we're alone <br>
            <br>
            We were built to last <br>
            We were built like that <br>
            Baby, take my hand <br>
            Dive in this romance <br>
            We could burn and crash <br>
            We could take a chance <br>
            Holdin' nothin' back <br>
            Like it's our last dance <br>
<br>
           <span>Ref:</span> <br> Like it's our last dance <br>
            Like it's our last dance <br>
            Like it's our last dance <br>
            Like it's our last dance <br>
